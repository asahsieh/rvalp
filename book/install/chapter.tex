\chapter{Installing a RISC-V Toolchain}
\label{chapter:install}

All of the software presented in this text was assembled using the
GNU toolchain and executed using the rvddt simulator on a Linux
(Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) operating system.

The installation instructions provided here were tested on a
clean OS install on June 9, 2018.

\section{The GNU Toolchain}

\enote{It would be good to find some Mac and Windows users to write 
and test proper variations on this section to address those systems.
Pull requests, welcome!}%
In order to install custom code in a location that will not cause 
interference with other applications (and allow for easy hacking and
cleanup), these will install the toolchain under
a private directory: \verb@~/projects/riscv/install@.  At any time
you can remove the lot and start over by executing the following 
command:

\begin{tty}
rm -rf ~/projects/riscv/install
\end{tty}

Be {\em very} careful how you type the above \verb@rm@ command.  
If typed incorrectly, it could irreversibly remove many of your files!

Before building the toolchain, a number of utilities must be present on 
your system.  The following will install those that are needed:

\begin{tty}
sudo apt install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev \
    libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf \
    libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev
\end{tty}

Note that the above \verb@apt@ command is the only operation that should
be performed as root.  All other commands should be executed as a regular 
user.  This will eliminate the possibility of clobbering system files that 
should not be touched when tinkering with the toolchain applications.

\enote{Discuss the choice of ilp32 as well as what the other variations 
would do.}%
To download, compile and ``install'' the toolchain:

\begin{tty}
mkdir -p ~/projects/riscv
cd ~/projects/riscv
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
INS_DIR=~/projects/riscv/install/rv32i
./configure --prefix=$INS_DIR --with-arch=rv32i --with-abi=ilp32
make
\end{tty}

After building the toolchain, make it available by putting it into
your PATH by adding the following to the end of your \verb@.bashrc@ file:

\begin{tty}
export PATH=$PATH:~/projects/riscv/install/rv32i/bin
\end{tty}

For this \verb@PATH@ change to take place, start a new terminal or paste the
same \verb@export@ command into your existing terminal.

\section{rvddt}

Download and install the rvddt simulator by executing the following 
commands.
Building the rvddt example programs will verify that the GNU toolchain
has been built and installed properly.

%git clone git@github.com:johnwinans/rvddt.git
\begin{tty}
cd ~/projects/riscv
git clone https://github.com/johnwinans/rvddt.git
cd rvddt/src
make world
cd ../examples
make world
\end{tty}

After building rvddt, make it available by putting it into your PATH 
by adding the following to the end of your \verb@.bashrc@ file:

\begin{tty}
export PATH=$PATH:~/projects/riscv/rvddt/src
\end{tty}

For this \verb@PATH@ change to take place, start a new terminal or paste the
same \verb@export@ command into your existing terminal.


Test the rvddt build by executing one of the examples:

\begin{tty}
winans@ux410:~/projects/riscv/rvddt/examples$ rvddt -f counter/counter.bin
sp initialized to top of memory: 0x0000fff0
Loading 'counter/counter.bin' to 0x0
This is rvddt.  Enter ? for help.
